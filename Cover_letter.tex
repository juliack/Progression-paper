Dear Editor of Journal X (/name of Editor in Chief/editor for section),

I am writing to you with respect to my paper submission entitled "Assessing the impacts of climate change on sea turtle nesting sites: distribution shifts and conservation needs for the Mediterranean loggerhead population". 

Using sea turtle nesting distribution and climatic projection data, my co-authors and I have shown that the suitability profile of the existing nesting sites in the Mediterranean will significantly change in coming decades. In areas that are projected to become unsuitable within the examined timeframe, our analysis suggests that changing timing of the nesting season would not be sufficient for . This is important because...
